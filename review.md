# Review

## Reproducibility Report
- I could run the code successfully by changing only **one line of code**.  
- The **reproducibility is really good**, and the project structure made it easy to follow.

## Overall Opinion
- Clear and well-organized project demonstrating what we learned in **Data Science 1**.  
- The documentation and analysis are understandable and consistent.  
- Good use of Git and clean coding style overall.

## Suggested Improvements
1. There are **too many commits** â€” consider making more substantial changes before committing.  
2. The **cleaned data** was saved to a **raw folder** instead of a dedicated folder like `cleaned_data/` or `data/clean/`.  
3. Consider creating a **Jupyter Notebook** with explanations and comments after each analysis step to make the results easier to interpret.
